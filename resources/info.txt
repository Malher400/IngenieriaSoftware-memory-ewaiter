MEMORY RULES
------------

Memory is a game of memorization for one or more players. 

In each turn, a player chooses two of the cards on the table, one after the other, revealing their content. 
If they have the same picture, the players is awarded some points and these cards stay lifted the rest of the game. Otherwise, they return to their original state, face down. 

The game ends once all cards have been discovered and the winner is the player with the most points.


Memory offers a few different options for a game:

- Number of players. Between 1-4 people.
- Board dimensions. The higher, the harder. The options are from 4x4 up to 16x4.
- Game Mode. Either classic or arcade (which includes special cards).
- Names of the players.
- Difficulty of automatic bots. The players are configured as human by default, but they can be turned into bots selecting between three levels of difficulty: easy, normal and hard.


The rules of the game are the following:

1) Two cards will be lifted in every turn (except special card).
2) If a player discovers a pair, he goes again.
3) Discovering a pair of basic cards is worth +10 points.


The special cards are:

· Bomb Card: A special card that takes 20 points off the unfortunte player who discovers it.
· Thief Pair: A special card that steals 10 points form all the other players and gives them to a lucky player.
· Golden Pair: A special card that awards a large sum of points to a lucky player (+50).
· DeathSkull Card: A special card that deletes all the points from the score of a very unfortunate player.
· Shield Pair: A special card that provides protection against all forms of misfortune for a lucky player.
· Elixir Pair: A special card that provides a 50% boost in all future points gained for a lucky player.
· Nightmare Card: A special card that puts an unfortunate player through a terrible nightmare. He loses a turn.
· Poison Card: A special card that decreases the amount of all future points gained for an unfortunate player (-20%).
